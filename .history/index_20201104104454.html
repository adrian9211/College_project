            <p>We think the native brown trout Salmo trutta are amazing and worth preserving for future generations.
              <br><br>
              They are an indicator of the health of a river or lake, and where they thrive you can be sure that other wildlife will thrive too. Many people are surprised and delighted to see trout in rivers in city centres or tiny mountain lakes, and we hope that seeing trout means they will value them and the places where they live.
              <br><br>
              Trout show remarkable variety and adaptability. It was originally thought that what we know today as Salmo trutta in the UK was 50 different species, because trout vary so much in appearance, size and habit. Analysis of genetics has shown there is only one species (i.e. all trout can interbreed with all other trout) but there is huge genetic variability even within the same river. Sea trout, ferox trout, dollaghan and gilaroo are just some of the more obvious trout variations, but research has shown that on the River Dart in Devon, for example, there are at least 22 genetically distinct breeding populations. </p>

            <p>Trout feed primarily on invertebrates that live in the river or lake, or drop on to the water from trees and plants on the banks. Some favourite trout food includes the freshwater shrimp (Gammarus), members of the mayfly family Ephemeroptera), caddis flies (Trichoptera) and stone flies (Plecoptera). </p>

              Trout in lakes
            </h3>
            <p>Trout generally spawn and go through their very early life stages in streams or rivers that feed into lakes rather than in the lake itself. Trout move into the lake as adults and, unlike river trout, will move around to find the best sources of food and shelter.</p>

            <p>We generally hold two ​‘members only’ fishing weekends each year. These are immensely popular and give our members the opportunity to meet up and fish together, with some expert local guidance on hand if needed. 

              The trout fishing weekend is generously donated by the Haddon Estate on the Derbyshire Wye. The Haddon waters are all wild brown and rainbow trout- the Derbyshire Wye is the only UK river with long established, self-sustaining population of wild rainbow trout as well as brown trout.</p>
